## Objective

This project is the first assignment of the Advanced Computer Architecture (ACA) subject directed by professor Ant√≥nio Borges.

The premise of this project was to implement the Hamming code for 1-bit error correction with the triplet [15, 11, 3], where:
- n (number of bits of the encoded message) = 15
- k (number of information bits) = 11
- d (Hamming distance) = 3.

The encoder and decoder had to be implemented with the structural modeling style in order to closely simulate and describe the hardware.

The module:

- encoder was implemented with a sequential digital circuit, from the schematics given by the professor
- decoder was implemented with a combinatorial digital circuit

## Theoretical Approach

In order to implement the encoder and decoder, we first calculated *n* and *k* based on the number of redundant bits *r* = 4 required by the project. The following formulas were used:

- length of the encoded message:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;![f1]

- length of the message:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;![f2]

### Encoder

The encoding process is described by the formula:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;![f3]

where:

- *x* is the encoded message
- *m* is the message to be encoded
- *G* is the *k* x *n* generator matrix

To get the generator matrix, the following formula was used:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;![f4]

where:
- ![f5] is the *k* x *k* identity matrix

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;![id_matrix_Ik]

- matrix A is composed of all permutations, of the redundant bits, with 2 or more bits equal to '1' (each column represents one permutation). The permutation order must be the same across both the encoder and decoder:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;![matrix_a]

- the transpose of matrix A can now be obtained:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;![matrix_a_transpose]

Concatenating both matrices results in the generator matrix used to produce the encoded message:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;![g_matrix]

The multiplication of the message by the last four columns of the G matrix resolves the 4 redundant bits. This operation is the same as using the four parity equations obtained from the A matrix:

### Decoder

The decoding process is described by the formula:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;![decoder_eq]

where:

- *y* is the received message, possibly with transmission errors, and ![y_t] is the transpose of *y*. This message is 15 bits long because it contains the four redundant bits.

- matrix H is obtained by:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;![matrix_h]

Matrix H is therefore:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;![matrix_h_values]

The result of multiplying the *H* matrix by ![y_t] allows for the detection of transmission errors:

- if all four parity bits are '0', then the message has no errors

- if one or more parity bits are '1', then the message has one or more errors

## Tools

The software Quartus Prime Lite Edition v18.1 was used to develop this project.

## Testing

To test the code it's advised to create a new project, create each individual file by copying and pasting the contents of the respective documents and create the simulation files from scratch. It's required to create new simulation files because Quartus stores in them the absolute path of the components used by the top level entity instead of their local paths, which may lead to errors during the simulations.
