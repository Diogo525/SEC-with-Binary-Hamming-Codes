## Objective

This project is the first assignment of the Advanced Computer Architecture (ACA) subject directed by professor Ant√≥nio Borges.

The premise of this project was to implement the Hamming code for 1-bit error correction with the triplet [15, 11, 3], where:
- n (number of bits of the encoded message) = 15
- k (number of information bits) = 11
- d (Hamming distance) = 3.

The encoder and decoder had to be implemented with the structural modeling style in order to closely simulate and describe the hardware.

The module:

- encoder was implemented with a sequential digital circuit, from the schematics given by the professor
- decoder was implemented with a combinatorial digital circuit

## Implementation

In order to implement the encoder and decoder, we first calculated *n* and *k* based on the number of redundant bits *r* = 4 required by the project. The following formulas were used:

- length of the encoded message:

- length of the message:

### Encoder

The encoding process is described by the formula:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;![f3]

where:

- *x* is the encoded message
- *m* is the message to be encoded
- *G* is the *k* x *n* generator matrix

To get the generator matrix, the following formula was used:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;![f4]

where:
- ![f5] is the *k* x *k* identity matrix
